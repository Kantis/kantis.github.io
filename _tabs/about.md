I'm 35 years old. Living in Stockholm, Sweden. ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª 

Currently on an assignment where I get to work with Kotlin and loving it. Using Spring, Kotest, and Gradle as daily drivers. 

Interested in functional programming and category theory. Would love to work more with Ktor and Arrow.

Available on the [Kotlin slack](https://kotlin-lang.slack.com). @Kantis@fosstodon.org for Mastodon.
